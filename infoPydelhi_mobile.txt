Forked https://github.com/pydelhi/pydelhi_mobile to https://github.com/DaleEMoore/pydelhi_mobile.git
    because pydelhi_mobile seems to be an app that's acquiring data.

TODO
Run pydelhi_mobile and see if it acquires data.
    clone https://github.com/DaleEMoore/pydelhi_mobile.git
    create this file (infoPydelhi_mobile.txt) to capture the project.
    install requirements. What verison of Python? python2?
    python3 got ValueError: time data 'tracks' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d'
    try python2, install requirements. python2 runs fine, so far.

See how pydelhi_mobile acquires data.
    Links to https://feedback.pydelhi.org/ so the website collects data, not the kivy app.
